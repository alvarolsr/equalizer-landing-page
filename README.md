Newbie Challenge from Frontend Mentor

Finally completed this challenge, although it is not perfect!

Things I could not make work/display correctly:

- Background sizes and position: I used negative values as per design files, but they do not display the same way.

Things I did:

- Used normalize.css to reset CSS, added prefixes from Autoprefixer, and used preprocessor "prepros".
- Used mobile-first approach
- Set media queries break points at 480 pixels and 768 pixels
- Used flexbox for footer so elements are spaced evenly
- In the mid section, where the device, background pattern and orange box appear, I used percent margins so they appear to move nicely as the window resizes.

Learned a lot while doing my first challenge, and I would appreciate any feedback and recommendations.
