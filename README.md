## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I think my biggest learning during this challenge was CSS positioning. I had to use 'position: relative' in some divs in order to make z-index work, so some elements would appear in front of the others, and viceversa.

### Continued development

I could not position the background images correctly as per design, even though I used the same margin values. I still have to find out how to make it work, by trying different approaches.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me to find the way to space some elements horizontally and vertically in the right way.
- [CSS Layout Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning) - This guide from Mozilla was useful to understand some aspects of relative positioning.

## Acknowledgments

I did google a lot to solve this challenge. I found very interesting information in sites like stack overflow, in which I could see how other developers would approach very specific issues during a project.

## Summary

Newbie Challenge from Frontend Mentor

Finally completed this challenge, although it is not perfect!

Things I could not make work/display correctly:

- Background sizes and position: I used negative values as per design files, but they do not display the same way.

Things I did:

- Used normalize.css to reset CSS, added prefixes from Autoprefixer, and used preprocessor "prepros".
- Used mobile-first approach
- Set media queries break points at 480 pixels and 768 pixels
- Used flexbox for footer so elements are spaced evenly
- In the mid section, where the device, background pattern and orange box appear, I used percent margins so they appear to move nicely as the window resizes.

Learned a lot while doing my first challenge, and I would appreciate any feedback and recommendations.
